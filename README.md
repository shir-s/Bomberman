# Bomberman

A recreation of the classic Bomberman game, originally released in **1983**, developed as a solo final project for the *"Unity A"* course at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design.

## About the Game

This 2D Unity project faithfully reimagines the retro gameplay of Bomberman.  
Navigate grid-based levels using arrow keys or **WASD**, place bombs with **Spacebar**, and defeat enemies to progress through the stage.  
The sprite assets were sourced online to match the look and feel of the original 1980s game.

- `Spacebar`: Place a bomb  
- `Z`: Use teleporters  
- `W`: Interact with the door (after defeating all enemies)  

#### Developer Shortcuts
- `L`: Reset player position to the starting point  
- `R`: Restart the game  


## Technologies Used
